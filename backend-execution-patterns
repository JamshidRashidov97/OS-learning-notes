When in server we create a listener, the kernel of our server creates a socket & two queues: SYN and Accept. This queues lives in the kernel itself.


When client sends a Syn message  ----> Kernel adds that SYN to SYN queue. Then replies with SYN/ACK.
Then Client replies with ACK,
Kernel finds ACK that matches with the ACK that client sent. Then it removes the SYN from SYN queue to Accept queue.
Then the backend application reads the SYN from Accept queue and creates a connection.
Then file descriptor for connection is created.



Connection is the instance of the socket. It is the file descriptor that is created when the connection is established.
The socket is what we listen on, the connection is what we read/write on.

You can have hundreds of connections to the same socket.
